[STANDARDS]

-If you think of changes to standards or
 conventions or any addition please
 include it in the README
-All files should be named using camelCase (suckMyAss.png)
-All C# scripts should follow camelCase

 the start of each word and a space in between

-Currently the story script will be saved in main
 directory in the text file [SINGULARITY].txt

>ART

-All art assets should be 16 x 16 pixel tiles
-Art files should be tile maps for each related set
-Art files should be .png files with clear background
-Between each separate tile should be a 1 pixel padding
-Use a consistent view for top down on map and characters

 1) the basic start game with player's class theme

 character assets
-This includes sidekicks, story characters, all creatures,
 all robots, random npc's and bosses

-Map Tiles folder will hold all map tile assets and
 include world props and items
-Map tiles should include all possible corners
-Map tiles can all be placed in one file and
 all other props can be in a separate file


>AUDIO

-All audio must be same file type before adding
 to the game
-Music can be pulled from free to use sources online
-Sounds (SFX) can be pulled from online sources also
-Try to think of theme and level design for each map
 or room's music
-Sound effects should all ideally be same length
-It would be funny if we used a jarmbled text
 to speech voice for the computers and robots


>SCRIPTS

-This folder is not for the story script, but for the
 C# scripts
-All camelCase naming conventions strictly apply to
 all scripts to be used by unity
